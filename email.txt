Hi, sorry for the slow response. I got a bit discouraged by all the git problems, and distracted by a new job. But I should still be around as needed (and hopefully get back to some of my in-progress ghilbert projects).

I've moved the final proof step in each block outside the <d> tags, and pushed the result to TODO-github-link.

I've also enclosed a copy of Relations.gh as an attachment, although you might need some of the interfaces which it imports too from git (if you are having trouble with ghilbert git, running "git clone GITHUB-ADDRESS" should be a trouble-free way of getting the files as of the last time I pushed my tree to github).

I'm still not seeing the structured comments being treated as anything but comments (if you are, please clue me in on exactly what pages I should look at and what the expected behavior is).

Thanks,

Jim
